# SAQUET: Scalable Automatic Question Usability Evaluation Toolkit

## Demo
saquet.io
Note, I just got this working on GCP and such on 05-21-2025, will look to update it next week to be more usable!

## About
SAQUET provides an automatic method to apply the 19-criteria Item Writing Flaws for evaluating the quality of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)!  
This toolkit aids in assessing MCQ quality effectively.

## Recent Changes
01/21/2025: Updated around half the criteria to follow a ratings-based approach, that now asks for a score 1-10 when the LLM verification happens and takes the average of three scores. Also uses gpt-4o currently.
