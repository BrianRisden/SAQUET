"With exams looming, your room in is a state of disarray. You don't know if you can comfort yourself with the confidence of being able to pass your BCHM exam but maybe the messiness of your room could help. Clothes, folders, sheets of paper, bags, food and cups are strewn everywhere and you can't find a single thing. This is reminiscent of amino acids because there are so many different individual molecules- just like there are so many individual things around your room. Which of the following in the analogy does NOT reflect amino acid metabolism?","Just like folding your clothes into piles and storing cups and food in a nicer, cleaner fashion, the body can shuffle amino acids around and restructure them into molecules except it is a process that doesn't need a cofactor or ATP.","You realise the protocol you need for your lab is missing. But did you print it? No matter how many folders and A4 sheets you have around the house, if you didn't print it, it's not going to be there, just like if you don't eat a particular essential amino acid, it's not going to magically appear...","When you finally get around to cleaning up your room, everything has its own place and method of disposing- cups will be washed as do clothes but notes will be filed away. This is like amino acids where each amino acid has a separate route of metabolism and disposal.","Cleaning up will probably require you to leave your room to go to the bin or the kitchen to put back the uneaten food or wash the cups. Unfortunately, you cannot hole up in there forever :( just like amino acid disposal will span the over different organs","Just like folding your clothes into piles and storing cups and food in a nicer, cleaner fashion, the body can shuffle amino acids around and restructure them into molecules except it is a process that doesn't need a cofactor or ATP.",,,,,Think back to chapter 3 of the textbook.,Great job!

"Explain the logic behind and the process of hypotheses testing. In particular, explain what the p-value is and how it is used to draw conclusions.",The p-value approach to hypothesis testing uses the calculated probability to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis.,The p-value approach to hypothesis testing uses the calculated probability to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis.,The p-value approach to hypothesis testing uses the calculated probability to determine whether there is evidence to approve the null hypothesis.,The p-value approach to hypothesis testing uses the variables to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis.,The n-value approach to hypothesis testing uses the calculated probability to determine whether there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis.,,,,,,
"Which of the following are correct about the structure of the affinity diagram?

A. The blue, pink, and green labels in affinity diagrams are used to indicate the importance of the features in the data collected, helping identify critical issues to address.

B. Affinity diagrams use blue, pink, and green labels to differentiate data source types, with blue for interviews, pink for interpretation, and green for diagramming.

C. The purpose of the blue, pink, and green labels in affinity diagrams is solely to add aesthetic appeal and does not impact data organization or analysis.",None of the above,A,B,C,A and B,A and C,B and C,All of the above,None of the above,,
